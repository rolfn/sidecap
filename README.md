LaTeX package that defines figure/table environments with side labeling

The sidecap package. 

This package defines the new environments SCfigure and SCtable, analogous to 
figure and table, which make it easy to typeset captions sideways. The package
knows the options outercaption, innercaption, leftcaption and rightcaption.
